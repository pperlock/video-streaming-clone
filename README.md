# Video Streaming Clone

This project is a basic React project that employs Redux for state management demonstrating the front and backend skills required to build a video streaming clone.  A basic login screen has been applied.  Users can enter the site by providing a username which will allow them to post videos and make comments with that username and their avatar.  Proper authentication has not yet been applied.

To Run the Project:
- git clone
- npm i
- sign in with one of the following usernames: mlyons, gwong, tduncan, cjones

Tech Stack:
Front End: React, Redux, HTML, SASS, Responsive Design, Mockup Realization.
Back End: Node, Express.


Future considerations: Proper Authentication, Implement a Database, Ability to sign up for an account
